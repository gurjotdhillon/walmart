### Data cleaning
The data set did not need any cleaning as the data types were correct, there were no missing values and i just needed to create a few new columns.

### Analysis
Upon inspecting the data I decided to focus on the following aspects for analysis:
1. Product
   - What is the most selling product?
   - How many cities are included in the data set?
   - what is the demographic distribution across the branch
   - Analysis of Member vs Normal customers

2. Time Analysis
   - What is the busiest period for sales- Morning, afternoon, or evening
   - which is the busiest hour
   - What is the average hourly traffic

3. Financial Analysis
   - How did sales grow daily?
   - What's the most profitable product line category?
